# Multiprogramming Operating System Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains a simulation of a multiprogramming operating system implemented in C++. The OS handles various jobs, manages errors like time limit exceeded, line limit exceeded, and stores data in virtual memory using segmentation. This project serves as a simulation of an operating system environment.

## Features

- Multiprogramming: The OS supports the execution of multiple programs concurrently.
- Job Management: Handles various jobs and processes.
- Error Handling: Manages errors such as time limit exceeded, line limit exceeded, etc.
- Virtual Memory: Stores data in virtual memory using segmentation.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed to run the C++ code.
2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kartik-Katkar/Multiprogramming-Operating-System.git
    cd Multiprogramming-Operating-System
    ```
